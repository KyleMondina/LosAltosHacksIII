    <h1>Patriotic Pirates</h1>
    <p>Patriotic Pirates is a web app created at Los Altos Hacks 2018. We came up with Patriotic Pirates, a name based on our school mascots. This app was created in order to address the problem of multiple choice questions.  We believed that these questions were too rigid and limited and neglected to address skills such as problem-solving or critical thinking. In order to better able measure their students’ current progress, this app allows teachers to create open ended questions. These questions require students to formulate an argument in support of their answer. Rather than providing a  setted yes or no response, students are now able to demonstrate their understanding of the course through a thoughtful and well-explained answer.</p>

    <h1>Tools and Technologies</h1>
        <p>The tools and technologies used to build this app were Desmos, MathJax, and Socket.io. Desmos allow students to create graphs and record them in their workspace. MathJax renders complex math equations, displaying them as readable text. Socket.io routes the student’s text-strings, images of graph, and Latex symbols-to a teacher’s computer.</p>
